                        Testing (VAPT) service. Our expert team is dedicated to assessing and fortifying your

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-5 mb-3">What We Offer</h2>
                    <p>Our VAPT service begins with a detailed assessment phase where we thoroughly examine your
                        network, applications, and systems to identify potential vulnerabilities. Using a combination of
                        automated tools and manual testing methodologies, we uncover weaknesses that malicious
                        actors could exploit.</p>
                    <p>Next, we conduct penetration testing, simulating real-world cyber attacks to assess the
                        effectiveness of your security controls. This involves attempting to exploit identified
                        vulnerabilities in a controlled environment to determine the extent of potential risks.</p>
