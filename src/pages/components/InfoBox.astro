            <p class="mt-4">Organizations and individuals face numerous challenges in the realm of cybersecurity, primarily due to the rapidly evolving threat landscape and the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks. One of the significant challenges is the shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals, which makes it difficult for companies to adequately protect their digital assets.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">The dynamic nature of threats requires continuous monitoring and updating of security measures, which can be resource-intensive. Moreover, human error remains a critical vulnerability, as employees may inadvertently fall victim to phishing schemes or other social engineering tactics. </p>
